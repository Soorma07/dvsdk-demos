NAME
       encodedecode - encode and decode video

SYNOPSIS
       encodedecode [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This demo uses the Codec Engine to encode data from the capture device
       into an intermediate buffer before the data is decoded to the display 
       framebuffer.

       The DM365MM and CMEM kernel modules need to be inserted for this demo
       to run.  Use the script 'loadmodule-rc' in the DVSDK to make sure both
       kernel modules are loaded with adequate parameters.

OPTIONS
       -y <1-7>, --display_standard <1-7>
             Sets the resolution of the display. If the captured resolution
             is larger than the display it will be center clamped, and if it
             is smaller the image will be centered.

                    1       D1 @ 30 fps (NTSC) 
                    2       D1 @ 25 fps (PAL)
                    3       720P @ 60 fps      [Default]                   
                    7       480P @ 60 fps 

       -v <videocodec>, --videocodec <h264 or mpeg4 or mpeg2>
             The video codec to be used for encode and decode

       -r <resolution>, --resolution <resolution>
             The resolution of video to encode and decode in the format
             'width'x'height'. Default is the resolution of the input video
             standard detected.

       -b <bit rate>, --bitrate <bit rate>
             This option sets the bit rate with which the video will be
             encoded. Use a negative value for variable bit rate. Default is
             variable bit rate.

       -p, --passthrough
             Pass the video through from capture device to display device
             without encoding or decoding the data.

       -I, --video_input
		     Video input source to use.
                 1       Composite                                                       
                 2       S-video                                                         
                 3       Component                                                       
                 4       Imager/Camera - for DM368  
             When not specified, the video input is chosen based on the display 
             video standard selected. NTSC/PAL use Composite, and 480P/720P use 
             Component.

       -k, --keyboard
             Enables the keyboard input mode which lets the user input
             commands using the keyboard in addition to the QT-based OSD
             interface. At the prompt type 'help' for a list of available
             commands.

       -t <seconds>, --time <seconds>
             The number of seconds to run the demo. Defaults to infinite time.

       -o, --osd
             Enables the On Screen Display for configuration and data 
             visualization using a QT-based UI. If this option is not passed, 
             the data will be output to stdout instead.

       -h, --help
             This will print the usage of the demo.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       First execute this script to load kernel modules required:
             ./loadmodules.sh

       General usage:
             ./encodedecode -h

       Use NTSC CIF resolution with keyboard interface and quit after 20 sec:
             ./encodedecode -r 352x240 -v h264 -t 20 -k

       Use a PAL display with OSD display and mpeg4 codec:
             ./encodedecode -y 2 -v mpeg4 -o

       Use default resolution (720x480) at 2Mbit bit rate with  mpeg4 codec and s-video input:
             ./encodedecode -b 2000000 -I 2

KNOWN ISSUES

VERSION
       4.02

CHANGELOG
       from 4.01:
             Modified data flow to eliminate frame copies to maximize
             performance. The application is no longer centering the display as
             a result.             

             To improve performance further, we have also moved to using the
             restricted (closed-loop) version of the H264 and MPEG4 decoder.

             The application now defaults to 720P resolution instead of D1 when
             display standard -y3 is selected. Use the -r flag if D1 resolution
             is needed. 

       from 4.0:
             Added support of Camera input for DM368.

             Removed s-video (-x) option.

             Added option to select video input source (-I)

       from 3.10:
             Replaced old remote-driven interface with QT-based interface. This
             can be turned on using the '-o' flag.

             Added MPEG2 support.
