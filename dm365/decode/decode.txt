NAME
       decode - decode video and/or audio or speech files

SYNOPSIS
       decode [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This demo uses the Codec Engine to decode data from files and output
       the uncompressed data using peripheral device drivers. Video, audio and 
       speech files are supported.  All files must consist of raw encoded 
       frames of data (elementary streams). For MPEG4 and H264 video, we use 
       the restricted version of the decoder, hence only videos encoded with
       TI encoder can be decoded.

       You must supply at least one file for the demo to run.

       The DM365MM and CMEM kernel modules need to be inserted for this demo
       to run.  Use the script 'loadmodule-rc' in the DVSDK to make sure both
       kernel modules are loaded with adequate parameters.

OPTIONS
       -v <video file>, --videofile <video file>
             Decodes a video file.  The demo detects which type of video file
             is supplied using the file extension.  Supported video algorithms
             are:

                 MPEG4 SP (.mpeg4 or .m4v extension)
                 H.264 HP (.264 extension)
                 MPEG2 (.m2v extension)

       -s <speech file>, --speechfile <speech file>
             Decodes the speech file. The demo detects which type of speech
             file is supplied using the file extension. The only supported
             speech algorithm as of now is G.711 (.g711 extension).

       -a <audio file>, --audiofile <audio file>
             Decodes the audio file. The demo detects which type of audio
             file is supplied using the file extension. The only supported
             audio algorithm as of now is AAC (.aac extension).

       -y <1-3>, --display_standard <1-3>
             Sets the resolution of the display. Clips larger than the display
             will be center clamped, and clips smaller than the display will
             be centered.

                    1       D1 @ 30 fps (NTSC) 
                    2       D1 @ 25 fps (PAL)
                    3       720P @ 60 fps   [Default]
                    5       1080I @ 30 fps - for DM368  

       -O <display output>, --display_output
             Selects the video output to display, valid outputs are
             'composite', or 'component'. 

       -l, --loop
             If this option is selected, the demo will restart at the
             beginning of a file (or files) when the end is reached. If this
             option is not selected (which is the default) the demo will quit
             once the end of the file (or files) has been reached.

       -o, --osd
             Enables the On Screen Display for configuration and data 
             visualization using a QT-based UI. If this option is not passed, 
             the data will be output to stdout instead.

       -k, --keyboard
             Enables the keyboard input mode which lets the user input
             commands using the keyboard in addition to the QT-based OSD
             interface. At the prompt type 'help' for a list of available
             commands.

       -t <seconds>, --time <seconds>
             The number of seconds to run the demo. Defaults to infinite time.

       -h, --help
             This will print the usage of the demo.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       First execute this script to load the kernel modules required:
             ./loadmodules.sh

       General usage:
             ./decode -h

       H264 HP  video on a 720p display and G.711 speech decode with OSD:
             ./decode -s test.g711 -v test.264 -o -y 3

       MPEG4 NTSC video decode only with keyboard interface on component output:
             ./decode -v test.mpeg4 -k -y 1

KNOWN ISSUES

VERSION
       4.02

CHANGELOG
       from 4.01:
             Modified data flow to eliminate frame copies to maximize 
             performance.

             To improve performance further, we have also moved to using the
             restricted (closed-loop) version of the H264 and MPEG4 decoder.

             The result is that only clips encoded with TI encoders can be 
             played back using this version of the demo.

       from 4.0:
             No change.

       from 3.10:
             Replaced old remote-driven interface with QT-based interface. This
             can be turned on using the '-o' flag.

             Added audio thread to allow audio playback.

             Added option for audio support ('-a').

             Added MPEG2 support.
