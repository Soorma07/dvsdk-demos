NAME
       encode - encode video and/or audio or speech files

SYNOPSIS
       encode [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This demo uses the Codec Engine to encode data from peripheral device
       drivers to files. Video, audio and speech files are supported. The files
       created will be encoded elementary streams of video/audio/speech.

       You must supply at least one file for the demo to run.

       The DM365MM and CMEM kernel modules need to be inserted for this demo
       to run.  Use the script 'loadmodule-rc' in the DVSDK to make sure both
       kernel modules are loaded with adequate parameters.

OPTIONS
       -v <video file>, --videofile <video file>
             Encodes video data to the given file. The file will be created if
             it doesn't exist, and truncated if it does exist. The demo
             detects which type of video file is supplied using the file
             extension. Supported video algorithm is MPEG4 SP, H.264 MP, MPEG2
             (.mpeg4 or .m4v extension, .264, .m2v).

       -s <speech file>, --speechfile <speech file>
             Encodes speech data to the given file. The file will be created
             if it doesn't exist, and truncated if it does exist. The demo
             detects which type of speech file is supplied using the file
             extension. The only supported speech algorithm as of now is
             G.711 (.g711 extension).

       -a <audio file>, --audiofile <audio file>
             Encodes audio data to the given file. The file will be created
             if it doesn't exist, and truncated if it does exist. The demo
             detects which type of audio file is supplied using the file
             extension. The only supported speech algorithm as of now is
             AAC (.aac extension).

       -y <1-5>, --display_standard <1-5>
             Sets the resolution of the display. If the captured resolution
             is larger than the display it will be center clamped, and if it
             is smaller the image will be centered.

                    1       D1 @ 30 fps (NTSC)
                    2       D1 @ 25 fps (PAL)
                    3       720P @ 60 fps    [Default]
                    5       1080I @ 30 fps - for DM368  

       -r <resolution>, --resolution <resolution>
             The resolution of video to encode in the format 'width'x'height'.
             Default is the size of the video standard (720x480 for NTSC,
             720x576 for PAL, 1280x720 for 720P).

       -b <bit rate>, --videobitrate <bit rate>
             This option sets the bit rate with which the video will be
             encoded. Use a negative value for variable bit rate. Default is
             variable bit rate.

       -p <bit rate>, --soundbitrate <bit rate>
             This option sets the bit rate with which the audio will be
             encoded. Use a negative value for variable bit rate. Default is
             96000.

       -u <sample rate>, --samplerate <sample rate>
             This option sets the sample rate with which the video will be
             encoded. Default is 44100 Hz.

       -w, --preview_disable
             Disable preview of captured video frames.

       -f, --write_disable
             Disable recording of encoded file. This helps to validate 
             performance without file I/O.

       -I, --video_input
		     Video input source to use.
                 1       Composite                                                       
                 2       S-video                                                         
                 3       Component                                                       
                 4       Imager/Camera - for DM368  
             When not specified, the video input is chosen based on the display 
             video standard selected. NTSC/PAL use Composite, 720P uses 
             Component, and 1080I uses the Imager/Camera.

       -l, --linein
             This option makes the input device for sound recording be the
             'line in' as opposed to the 'mic in' default.

       -k, --keyboard
             Enables the keyboard input mode which lets the user input
             commands using the keyboard in addition to the QT-based OSD
             interface. At the prompt type 'help' for a list of available
             commands. 

       -t <seconds>, --time <seconds>
             The number of seconds to run the demo. Defaults to infinite time.

       -o, --osd
             Enables the On Screen Display for configuration and data 
             visualization using a QT-based UI. If this option is not passed, 
             the data will be output to stdout instead.

       -h, --help
             This will print the usage of the demo.
